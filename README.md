# EarlyBirdsCo
This is the group project of the Early Birds.

This is a project we worked on in our second year, in a team of five people.
It acts as the back-end system for a small company selling mechanical keyboard keycaps.
We were directed to use the decade old asp.net web forms system, meaning no JavaScript was used, nothing client-side.
It essentially acts as a front-end the University's SQL server.
It uses stored procedures to add, delete and edit records in one of five tables.
